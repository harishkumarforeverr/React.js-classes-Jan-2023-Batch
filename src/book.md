The World's Largest Software Registry (Library)
npm is the world's largest Software Registry.

The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.

Open-source developers use npm to share software.

Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.

Using npm is Free
npm is free to use.

You can download all npm public software packages without any registration or logon.

Command Line Client
npm includes a CLI (Command Line Client) that can be used to download and install software:

Windows Example
C:\>npm install <package>

# npx create react app command

Create React App
Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

# node.js environment

The Node. js runtime is the software stack responsible for installing your web service's code and its dependencies and running your service. The Node.js runtime for App Engine in the standard environment is declared i

What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

JSX allows us to write HTML in React.

JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

Coding JSX
JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods.

JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.

You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.

Here are two examples. The first uses JSX and the second does not:

Example 1
JSX:

const myElement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>;

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myElement);

Example 2
Without JSX:

const myElement = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'I do not use JSX!');

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myElement);

As you can see in the first example, JSX allows us to write HTML directly within the JavaScript code.

JSX is an extension of the JavaScript language based on ES6, and is translated into regular JavaScript at runtime.

# JAVASCRIPT

1.  Introduction
    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node

2.  History of JavaScript
    JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.

3.  Download and Install vscode

4.  How to execute javascript code
    script tag in html and browser console and in js file

5.  Hello World program
    console.log("hello wordl") in 4 point

6.  Intro to variables
    4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
    Using var
    Using let
    Using const
    Using nothing (by default its a consider a var)

    <!-- completed  -->

7.  Rules for naming variables
    A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore character (_) A variable name cannot start with a digit. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores ( a-z, A-Z , 0-9 , and _ ) Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

8.  Let keyword
    let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which declares a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope

9.  Const keyword
    The const declaration creates block-scoped constants, much like variables declared using the let keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can't be redeclared (i.e. through a variable declaration).

10. var keyword
    The var statement declares a variable. Variables are containers for storing information. Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable: var carName; After the declaration, the variable is empty (it has no value).

11. object and

12. object destructure, Object extracting values and Object keys and Object.values

13. Array and

14. Array destructure

15. boolean

16. number

17. map method

18. String Indexing
    JavaScript Strings
    The indexOf() Method
    indexOf() returns the position of the first occurrence of a value in a string.

    Find "welcome": out ==>13

    // code
    let text = "Hello world, welcome to the to universe.";
    let result = text.indexOf("to");
    console.log(result);

19. Useful string methods

    1. String constructor
    2. concat
    3. slice()
    4. split() splict(" ")
    5. - operator

20. typeof , string to number, number to string conversion
    console.log(typeof "star", typeof 12, typeof true);
    const no = "20";
    console.log(typeof no);
    const newNo = Number(20);
    console.log(typeof newNo);
    const SmallNo = String(20);
    console.log(typeof SmallNo);

21. Template Strings
    const name = "Johnny";
    const age = 20;
    const str = `He's often called ${name} ${age}`;
    const newStr = "He's often called " + name + " " + age;
    console.log(str, newStr);

22. undefined null

<!--  enoghy today -->

21. if else , truthy and falsy values
    // if (true) {
    // console.log("ok");
    // }
    // if (false) {
    // console.log("ok");
    // }
    // if (0) {
    // console.log("ok");
    // }
    // if ("") {
    // console.log("ok");
    // }
    // if (null) {
    // console.log("ok");
    // }

// if (undefined) {

// console.log("ok");
// }

// if (11) {
// console.log("ok");
// }
// if ("sss") {
// console.log("ok");
// }

for (let x in person) {
text += person[x];
}

const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
text += x;
}

35. getElementById and getElementByClassName

const App = () => {
// const myname = document.getElementById("name");
// console.log(myname.innerHTML, (myname.style.color = "red"));
// // const myname = document.getElementsByClassName("age");
// // console.log(myname[0].innerHTML, (myname[0].style.color = "red"));
// // console.log(myname[1].innerHTML, (myname[1].style.color = "green"));
return (

<div>
<h1 id="name">harish</h1>
<h1 className="age">22</h1>
<h1 className="age">22</h1>
</div>
);
};
